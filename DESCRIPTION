Title: A package for estimating PCA with a Variational Bayes algorithm
Version: 0.0.1

Description: `bayespca` performs Bayesian estimation of weight vectors in PCA.
    To achieve regularization, the method allows specifying fixed variances
    in the prior distributions of the weights; alternatively, it is possible
    to implement Jeffrey's and  Inverse Gamma priors on such parameters.
    In turn, the Inverse Gamma's can have fixed shape hyperparameter; and
    fixed or random scale hyperparameter. Last, the method allows performing
    component-specific Stochastic Variable Selection (`spike-and-slab` prior).
