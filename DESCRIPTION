Title: A Package for Estimating PCA with Variational Bayes Inference
Version: 0.0.2
Authors: Davide Vidotto 
Maintainer: Davide Vidotto <d.vidotto@uvt.nl>
Description: Methods for Bayesian estimation of weight vectors in PCA.
    To achieve regularization, the method allows specifying fixed variances
    in the prior distributions of the weights; alternatively, it is possible
    to implement Jeffreys and  Inverse Gamma priors on such parameters.
    In turn, the Inverse Gamma's can have fixed shape hyperparameter; and
    fixed or random scale hyperparameter. Last, the method allows performing
    component-specific Stochastic Variable Selection (`spike-and-slab` prior).
